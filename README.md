## Exercises

### Task 1: Program calculate year of birth! 
Create a program that calculates the year of birth.
- First part:
    - define the variables `age` and `name`
    - make a calculation for the year in which the person was born
    - print out "OMG <person>, you are <age> years old, so you were born in <year>" with the correct values

- Second Part:
    - prompt the user for input and re-assigning the variable `age` and `name`
    - figure out a way to account for if the persons' birthday has already happened this year or not

- Extra
    - go look into the library time
    - print out the amount of hour this person has lived

### Task 2: Lists - Restaurant Waiter Helper program
- To make a program that helps a waiter with his menu and his orders.
- User Stories
    1. As a User I want to be able to see the menu in a formatted way, so that I can order my meal.

    2. As a User I want to be able to order 3 times, and have my responses added to a list, so they aren't forgotten

    3. As a user, I want to have my order read back to me in formatted way, so I know what I ordered.
    
### Task 3:Xmas Holiday List that never ends!

- User stories:
    1. As a user, I want to be able to add items to the list, so I can read it later.

    2. As a user, I want to be able to keep adding things to the list until I use exit

    3. As a user, I should be able to use the word exit in a sentence and still have the program terminate, so that anyone can use it

    4. as a user, when the program exits, I want to see the complete list in caps lock and numbered, so that I know what to buy. example:


### Task 4: Fizz Buzz!

- Core:
    - Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
    - For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number
    - For the multiples of five print "Buzz" instead of the number
    - For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

- Extra:
    - make a new fizzbuzz file and make it functional
    - make it, so we can decide which numbers to substitute for fizz and buzz using functions

### Task 5: Functional Calculator

- Complete the core tasks
- Core 1: build function containing
    - add,
    - subtract,
    - multiply,
    - divide.

- Core 2: Build more functions for
    - area of a circle
    - area of a square
    - area of a triangle (just find the easiest way)

- Extra:
    - run the function with arguments
    - assert against known values - so adding 10 + 30 will always be 40
    
### Task 6: Loops and lists

- make a loop with a range that says hello 10 times
- create another loop with a range that asks for names and appends to list_names
- make a loop that iterated over each name in list_names and format's it into lowercase in a new variable called list_names_lower
- Iterate over the list of values to find if they are even
